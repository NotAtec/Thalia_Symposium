With that team spirit, Hans and Gerrit Mulder started ChipSoft in 1986. Three decades later, that no-nonsense mentality is still at the heart of the company. Even more than ever, as the Mulders now have over 900 'Chippies'.

  All those hundreds of employees are given room to develop themselves through courses and training. And to develop their own ideas. Because at ChipSoft, we believe in the motto 'better well thought out than well stolen'. This freedom also applies to activities with your colleagues.
  
  What is typical ChipSoft? Teaching a medical specialist the intricacies of our software. But also organising a sports activity for your colleagues. Or developing a solution that optimises patient logistics in hospitals. All with one common goal: strengthening our leading position in the world of healthcare ICT.
